Data from 20CRv3 and reanalysis experiments for Storm Ulysses in February 1903.
 
The four folders are for different versions of the reanalysis. The original data is in 20CRv3, with an experiment with additional observations in PlusObs and an experiment with additional observations and an improved data assimilation scheme in PlusObsImprovedAssim. Plus2K is the same as PlusObsImprovedAssim but run with +2K warmer SSTs.
 
The folders include data for precipitation (PRATE), mean sea level pressure (PRMSL), specific humidity (SPFH), temperature (TMP), u-winds (UGRD), and v-winds (VGRD). For SPFH, TMP, UGRD, and VGRD these are available for different levels in the atmosphere (2m/10m, and 1000, 925, 850, 700, 500 and 400mb).
 
Each file includes data for 16 timesteps (3-hourly data) during the storm, between 00 UTC on 26th February 1903 and 21 UTC on 27th February 1903, for a spatial domain centered on the UK.
